__SKI RESORT FORECAST__

__Motivation__

This application was primarily made as a means of looking at the weather for different Ski Resorts. I like to snowboard, so I found this project as a good way of getting some react JS experience as well as having a usable website for future snowboarding trips.

__How to use__

-1)type the name of a ski resort into the search box and press either enter on your keyboard or click the "search" button.

-2)You will be provided with a result that has the closest match to what you have input into the search box.

-3)Results provided for each search are top snow depth, bottom snow depth, last snowfall date, day temperature (Celsius), night temperature (Celsius), current time and current date.

-4)Repeat step 1 if you wish to look for another ski resort

__Challenges__

Continuously coming across undefined errors when trying to use API data, even though I could console.log the data before trying to use it. This was fixed by implementing some checks to make sure that the data was actually available from the API before trying to return the next component.
